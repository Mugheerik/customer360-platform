> A production-style Customer Data Platform (CDP) built with modern Python technologies and engineering best practices.

Customer360 Platform is a backend-focused engineering project that demonstrates how scalable APIs and data platforms are designed, built, tested, and maintained.

Rather than being a simple CRUD application, the project emphasizes clean architecture, maintainability, automated testing, database versioning, code quality, and continuous integration—mirroring practices commonly used in professional software teams.

---

## Why Customer360?

Customer360 aims to provide a unified view of customer information while serving as a foundation for future analytics, event processing, and customer intelligence capabilities.

The project demonstrates practical backend engineering concepts including:

* Clean Architecture
* Layered Application Design
* REST API Development
* Database Design
* Database Migrations
* Automated Testing
* Code Quality Automation
* Continuous Integration

## Architecture

The API follows a layered architecture to encourage separation of concerns and maintainability.

```text
HTTP Request
      │
      ▼
Router
      │
      ▼
Service
      │
      ▼
Repository
      │
      ▼
PostgreSQL
```

Each layer has a single responsibility:

* **Router** – Handles HTTP requests and responses.
* **Service** – Contains business logic.
* **Repository** – Manages database operations.
* **Models** – SQLAlchemy ORM entities.
* **Schemas** – Pydantic request/response models.

---

## Engineering Principles

Customer360 is built around production-oriented engineering practices:

* Modular project structure
* Layered architecture
* Dependency Injection
* Strong typing
* Database version control with Alembic
* Automated testing with Pytest
* Code quality enforcement using Ruff
* Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
* Docker-based local development

---
